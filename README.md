# Stock-Market-Predection
In thes project you can predict the stock price on the basic of pervious stock price value.

## Data Collection
* In these project I had collected data from below library
```bash
pip install pandas-datareader
```
### How To Collect Data
* From the documentation page of [library](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remote_data.html)
* Go on the [Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com/)
* Click On login and login yourself
* Then click after on API part on the left hand side of page.
* After that go on documentation, from that documentation you get your API key.
* Don't share your API key with anyone.

## Why Stacked LSTM Use
* In that case the main reason for stacking LSTM is to allow for greater model complexity. 
* In case of a simple feedforward net we stack layers to create a hierarchical feature representation of the input data to then use for some machine learning task. 
* The same applies for stacked LSTM's.
